                        of a child. Nearly two-thirds of the 6.5 million infant deaths each year occur within the first four 
                        weeks of life, and about two-thirds of those occur within the first week.</p>

                      <p class="lead">Children cannot achieve optimal health alone. They are dependent upon adults in their
                          family and community to provide them with an environment in which they can learn and
                          grow successfully. In addition, because they are continually growing physically and
                          mentally,CHPro success in achieving optimal child health will be challenging.
                          Maternal health status, habits, and environment during and even before pregnancy
                          profoundly impacts the health and well-being of a child. Thus, achieving optimal child
                          health is dependent upon optimizing the health and well-being of a child’s mother.
                          Child health is foundational to adult health and well-being. When children’s health is
                          nurtured and supported and there is an absence of physical and mental abuse, or other
                          intentional childhood trauma; and there exists opportunities to gain habits that support
                          good health during childhood, the stage is set for a healthy adulthood less likely to include
                          chronic health problems such as overweight/obesity, poor oral health, diabetes and other
                          chronic physical and mental health problems.</p>
                      <hr class="my-4">
                      <p>A healthy child's development actually begins before conception with the parents' health and their 
                        genetic legacy. It continues on to conception and through the prenatal period. During this time, there is 
                        naturally considerable overlap between pediatric concerns for the fetus and obstetrical concerns for the 
                        mother.

                          Once the baby is delivered, there are new and important matters to address, such as breastfeeding, 
                          newborn screening tests, and sleeping safety. All too soon, there are health care appointments to be 
                          kept for well-baby checkups and vaccinations. These are followed by other 
                          issues such as when and how to introduce solid foods, toilet training, and when to see the dentist.</p>

          <h2>Neonatal and Child Health in Nigeria</h2>
          <p><i>The life of every child counts,lets end the trend of child mortality now.</i></p>
          <p>Child mortality has been at the hub of health discourse since time immemorial. Governments, health 
            professionals, and policymakers have reserved an exclusive interest in reducing the prevalence of 
            childhood deaths globally. This interest has not only extended into the international scene, it 
            has led to the development of sound interventions to reducing child mortality among children under the 
            age of five between 1990 and 2015, and between 2015 and 2030 as tagged in the United Nation’s Millennium 
            Development Goals (MDGs), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) respectively</p>
            <p>
                The reduction of child mortality and the
                improvement of maternal health are two of the Millennium
                Development Goals. Child and maternal mortalities continue
                to represent severe burdens in many developing countries.
                Every year, 527,000 women in developing countries die of
                pregnancy-related complications and nearly 4 million
                children die during their first month (accounting for 40
                percent of all deaths under 5 years of age) with nearly all
                (98 percent) of them in developing countries. The risks of
                dying from pregnancy-related complications and a child dying
                under the age of five are highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The
                risk of a mother or an infant dying can be significantly
                reduced by a continuum of basic care, which should include
                preventive measures and a skilled attendant during
                childbirth with access to the necessary equipment, drugs,
                and other supplies for effective management of any
                pregnancy-related complications. Yet, many women spend
                excessive time trying to reach a health facility with the
                capacity to treat obstetric or infant complications. It is
                estimated that 75 percent of maternal deaths might be
                prevented through timely access to essential emergency
                childbirth-related care.
            </p>
          <p>Globally, Nigeria ranks second to India with the highest number of neonatal deaths.
              Under-Five Mortality Rates (U5M) remain high in Nigeria despite recent interventions. A U5M 
              of 128 deaths per 1000 live births as evidenced in the year 2013 Nigeria Demographic Health Survey 
              suggests that about one in every eight children in Nigeria dies before their fifth birthday—approximately 
              21 times the average rate in developed countries. Spanning a period of over two decades (1990 to 2015) 
              in Nigeria, Infant Mortality Rates (IMR) have reduced by 57% (from 126 to 69 deaths per 1000 births); 
              U5M fell by approximately 49% (from 213 to 109 deaths).</p>
          <p>Child deaths commonly result from several risk factors and preventable diseases. Acute Respiratory 
            Infections (ARIs), diarrhoea, malaria and chronic malnutrition contribute largely to disease morbidity 
            and mortality among children. Deaths in the first 28 days of life has been linked to the endogenous 
            (genetically-induced malfunctions, premature births) status of a child, quality of antenatal care, 
            whether assistance was given during delivery and post-partum care. However, deaths in the succeeding 
            11 months are often tied to the wealth status of the households, environmental factors, health behaviour 
            and nutritional practices. Several other factors have been linked with infant and child deaths. Such 
            factors among others include maternal education, early marriage, place of residence, regional variations, 
            short birth intervals, fertility behaviour, breastfeeding practices, use of health services by mother and 
            or child, child’s sex, ethnicity and religion.</p>
